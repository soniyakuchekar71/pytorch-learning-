# PyTorch Lesson 1 — Tensors

This lesson introduces the basic building block of PyTorch: **tensors**.

## What I Learned

* What a tensor is
* Creating tensors using `torch.tensor()`
* Scalar, 1D, and 2D tensors
* Checking tensor shape using `.shape`
* Basic tensor operations
* Tensor addition
* Element-wise multiplication

## Examples

### Scalar

```python
torch.tensor(5)
```

A scalar contains a single value.

### 1D Tensor

```python
torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
```

A 1D tensor is similar to a vector.

### 2D Tensor

```python
torch.tensor([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
])
```

A 2D tensor is similar to a matrix.

## Key Takeaway

**A tensor is a multi-dimensional array used to store and process data in PyTorch.**

Tensors are important because neural networks use them for inputs, outputs, weights, and other computations.

## Practice

I practiced creating different types of tensors, checking their shapes, and performing basic operations.
